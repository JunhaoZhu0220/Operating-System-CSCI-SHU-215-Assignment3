Files submitted:

include:
    os-scheduling.h: Q1-Q3 (Provided)

src:
    sched-policies.c: Q1-Q3 (Implemented RR, MFQ, and IORR, added a new function dequeue_with_idx for easier dequeue manipulation)
    sched-simulator.c: Q1-Q3 (Modified for applying policy parameters)

RR-run.txt: Q1 (Output file with tasks5 and RR, quantum 4)
MFQ-run.txt: Q2 (Output file with tasks5 and MFQ, quantum 3)
iorr-run.txt: Q3 (Output file with tasks6 and IORR, quantum 4)

=======================================================================================
Targets in the Makefile:
    For RR and MFQ:
    change the FILE variable to one of the following: tasks, tasks2, tasks3, tasks4, tasks5
    change the POLICY variable to RR or MFQ accordingly, and an extra value for quantum, then run `make`. (e.g. RR 4; MFQ 3)
    For IORR:
    change the FILE variable to tasks6 or any custom tasks which have the same format of tasks6
    change the POLICY variable to IORR, and an extra value for quantum, then run `make`. (e.g. IORR 3)

=======================================================================================
Comments:
The format of printed queues following the fashion of example-outputs/t4rr.txt.
